This project simulates a system conversion or an initiative to convert legacy system 
codes used for customers, suppliers, expense accounts, etc.  In this case, we are 
simulating a health care insurance provider who is changing codes for it's membership, providers, locations, etc.

The data wrangling was written in Python using Pandas for grouping, manipulating and changing.  The charts were prepared using Matplotlib and Seaborn. JupyterLab, an open source web application, was used for coding and visualizations. 

The project contains goals and objectives for the following groups:
- Members
- Insurance Claims
- Provider Specialty
- Provider IDs
- Provider Location
- Injury and Disease (ICD)

As a former Certified Public Accountant (CPA) I was intimately involved in a few system conversion projects brought about through acquisitions, updating legacy systems or upgrading to new platforms or software in the accounting, human resources, manufacturing or purchasing disciplines.  This is
my view of how the IT and functional area experts might approach an initiative.
