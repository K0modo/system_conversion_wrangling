This project simulates a system conversion or an initiative to convert legacy system 
codes used for customers, suppliers, expense accounts, etc.  In this case, we are 
simulating a health care insurance provider who is changing codes for it's membership, providers, locations, etc.

The data wrangling was done using Python Pandas with JupyterLab.  Data was organized 
into the following groups:
- Members
- Insurance Claims
- Provider Specialty
- Provider IDs
- Provider Location
- Injury and Disease (ICD)

  Summary charts and tables are presented to assist with high-level assessments that the
  new datasets look complete.  Typically, deeper dives are done to look for errors as well
  as complementing a plan to handle customers or suppliers no longer doing business with the entity.
